Files is a modern file manager that helps users organize their files and folders. Our mission with Files is to build the best file manager for Windows, and weâ€™re proud to be building it out in the open so everyone can participate. User feedback helps shape the features we work on, & the bug reports on GitHub help to make Files more reliable. Built and maintained by the open-source community, Files features robust multitasking experiences, file tags, deep integrations, and an intuitive design.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is my personal fork of Files that addresses my specific needs and integrations within my homelab.  
> 
> It's unlikely it will work as well for most people as the standard version available [here](https://github.com/files-community/files).

## Key Changes (WIP)

- Tighter integration with my NextCloud and other self hosted services.
- Support for additional custom file and folder metadata.
- Support for nextcloud still folder readmes and file readmes.

## Building from source

Instructions for building the source code can be found on our [documentation site](https://files.community/docs/contributing/building-from-source).
